# 0. Your first programming
```
echo "Hello world"
```
# 1. Variable and operator
| Syntax          | Meaning                                                              | Example           |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| varname=value   | defines a variable                                                   | a=3               |
| let <operator>  | performs mathematical calculation using operators like +, -, *, /, % | let 1+2 b=let 3+4 |
| $((<operator>)) | performs mathematical calculation using operators like +, -, *, /, % | a=$((1+2))        |
Note: / will be rounded.  
  
# 2. Data type
Several data types,however,what you need to know enough in bash is number and character
Character/ String:
```
a="1"
```
Still character or string:
```
a=1  
```
Work with number:
```
echo $(("1"+"2"))
```
# 3. Condition
if [ conditions ]
    then
    commands
fi
  
| Operation             | syntax        | meaning                            |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Equality              | num1 -eq num2 | is num1 equal to num2              |
| Greater than equal to | num1 -ge num2 | is num1 greater than equal to num2 |
| Greater than          | num1 -gt num2 | is num1 greater than num2          |
| Less than equal to    | num1 -le num2 | is num1 less than equal to num2    |
| Less than             | num1 -lt num2 | is num1 less than num2             |
| Not Equal to          | num1 -ne num2 | is num1 not equal to num2          |
  
Ex:
Check weather 1 equal to 1
```
a=3
b=2
```
  
```  
if [ $a -gt $b ]
  then
  echo "1 greater than 2"
fi
```  
Note: There are spaces between the condition and []
For more advanced, it could be combined with more condition

# 4. Loop
+ Through sequence of numbers
```
for i in {1..5}
do
    echo $i
done
```
+ Through sequence of strings
```
for X in cyan magenta yellow  
do
	echo $X
done
```
  
# 5. Functions
## 5.1 Simple function
  function functname() {
  shell commands
}

Find the column name that match with you pattern and show the number of columns
```

```
Convert it into function
```
function header_finder() {
  head -n1 $1|tr "\t" "\n|nl|grep giang
} 
header_finder giang.txt
```  
## 5.2 Function with arguments  
if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:-word}
if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise return word
${varname:word}              
if varname exists and isn't null, return its value; otherwise set it word and then return its value
${varname:=word}

# The function refers to passed arguments by position (as if they were positional parameters), that is, $1, $2, and so forth.
# $@ is equal to "$1" "$2"... "$N", where N is the number of positional parameters. $# holds the number of positional parameters.




unset -f functname  # deletes a function definition
declare -f          # displays all defined functions in your login session

# COMMAND-LINE PROCESSING CYCLE
##############################################################################


# The default order for command lookup is functions, followed by built-ins, with scripts and executables last.
# There are three built-ins that you can use to override this order: `command`, `builtin` and `enable`.

command  # removes alias and function lookup. Only built-ins and commands found in the search path are executed
builtin  # looks up only built-in commands, ignoring functions and commands found in PATH
enable   # enables and disables shell built-ins

eval     # takes arguments and run them through the command-line processing steps all over again


##############################################################################
# INPUT/OUTPUT REDIRECTORS
##############################################################################


cmd1|cmd2  # pipe; takes standard output of cmd1 as standard input to cmd2
< file     # takes standard input from file
> file     # directs standard output to file
>> file    # directs standard output to file; append to file if it already exists
|tee <file># output command to both terminal and a file (-a to append to file)

# PROCESS HANDLING
##############################################################################


# To suspend a job, type CTRL+Z while it is running. You can also suspend a job with CTRL+Y.
# This is slightly different from CTRL+Z in that the process is only stopped when it attempts to read input from terminal.
# Of course, to interrupt a job, type CTRL+C.

wait                # waits until all background jobs have finished
sleep <number>      # wait # of seconds before continuing
