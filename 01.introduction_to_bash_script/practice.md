Sure! Here are some exercises for practicing bash scripting in bioinformatics:

Download a set of DNA sequence files in FASTA format from a public database, such as NCBI, and write a bash script that uses the command-line tool grep to extract sequences that match a specific pattern.

Write a bash script that uses the command-line tool

network error
blastn to search for similar sequences in a local database, using a query sequence in FASTA format.

Download a set of RNA-seq data files in FASTQ format from a public database, such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), and write a bash script that uses the command-line tool fastqc to assess the quality of the reads.

Write a bash script that uses the command-line tool cutadapt to trim adapter sequences from a set of Illumina RNA-seq data files in FASTQ format.

Download a set of protein sequence files in FASTA format from a public database, such as UniProt, and write a bash script that uses the command-line tool hmmscan to search for homologous protein domains.

Write a bash script that uses the command-line tool bedtools to intersect two sets of genomic intervals, such as ChIP-seq peaks and gene promoters.

Download a set of genome assembly files in FASTA format from a public database, such as the NCBI Genome database, and write a bash script that uses the command-line tool samtools to align RNA-seq reads to the genome and generate a BAM file.
