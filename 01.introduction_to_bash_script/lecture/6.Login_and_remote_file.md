# 1. Install and config ssh
Sure, here are the steps to install and use SSH to work as a server and client:

Install SSH Server

For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
For CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install openssh-server
Start SSH Server

For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl start ssh
For CentOS/RHEL: sudo systemctl start sshd
Enable SSH Server to start at boot

For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl enable ssh
For CentOS/RHEL: sudo systemctl enable sshd
Connect to the SSH Server from a client machine

Open a terminal on the client machine
Run ssh username@servername, where username is the username on the server and servername is the IP address or domain name of the server.
If this is the first time you are connecting to the server from this client machine, you will be prompted to accept the server's public key.

Enter the server user's password when prompted.

Once connected, you can run commands on the server from the client machine's terminal. For example, you can run ls to list the files in the server's current directory, or mkdir to create a new directory.

That's it! You can now use SSH to securely connect to and work on a remote server.

# 2. Check configuration of ssh
Sure, here are the steps to install and use SSH to work as a server and client:

Install SSH Server

For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install openssh-server
For CentOS/RHEL: sudo yum install openssh-server
Start SSH Server

For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl start ssh
For CentOS/RHEL: sudo systemctl start sshd
Enable SSH Server to start at boot

For Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl enable ssh
For CentOS/RHEL: sudo systemctl enable sshd
Connect to the SSH Server from a client machine

Run ssh username@servername, where username is the username on the server and servername is the IP address or domain name of the server.

That's it! You can now use SSH to securely connect to and work on a remote server.
# 2. Set up login with sra key
Generate a new SSH key pair on your local machine using the ssh-keygen command:
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
This will create a new SSH key pair in your home directory, with the public key saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and the private key saved in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.

Copy the public key to the SRA server using the ssh-copy-id command:
```
ssh-copy-id username@sra-server
```
Replace username with your SRA username and sra-server with the hostname or IP address of the SRA server.

Enter your SRA password when prompted.

Now try logging in to the SRA server using SSH:

```
ssh username@sra-server
```

This time, you should be able to log in without being prompted for a password.

Note: If ssh-copy-id is not available on your local machine, you can manually copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the .ssh/authorized_keys file on the SRA server using a text editor.

# 3. Install ngrok
https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/

It allow you to login with dynamic IP address
# 4. Install VPN


# 5. Set remote file system
Note: Please change it with your username
Install ssh
```
sudo apt-get install sshfs
```

Create folder to mount, replace any directory if you want to mount
```
mkdir -p /mnt/mountpointA
```

Try to mount on your terminal
```
sudo sshfs -o nonempty,allow_other,default_permissions giangnguyen@172.16.1.22:/home/giangnguyen/ /home/nguyen/mount/giangnguyen
```

Check df to get your new mount
```
df|grep 172
```
EX:giangnguyen@172.16.1.22:/home/giangnguyen/ 288521368 116767896 157024412  43% /home/nguyen/mount/giangnguyen

However, it will be disappeared when you do not configured them in fstab, similarly for other mount point, evenly with physical disk or partitions
Open fstab and create new config
```
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```
Copy and add to fstab
```
giangnguyen@172.16.1.22:/home/giangnguyen/ /home/nguyen/mount/giangnguyen fuse.sshfs defaults,IdentityFile=/home/nguyen/.ssh/id_rsa,allow_other,default_permissions 0 0
