# 1. Python introduction
Python is a common programming language that frequently use to solve the problem in bioinformatics field. Here are some key topics you should consider when studying Python:

1. Syntax: Learn the basic structure and syntax of the language, including variables, data types, control structures, functions, and modules.

Object-Oriented Programming: Understanding the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) is important in Python. Study classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

2. Standard Library: Get familiar with the Python Standard Library, which includes a large number of modules that provide useful functionality for tasks such as data processing, file handling, and web development.

3. Third-party Libraries: Learn how to install and use popular third-party libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for scientific computing, data analysis, and visualization.

4. Debugging and Error Handling: Practice debugging your code and learn how to handle exceptions and errors in a robust way.

5. Algorithms and Data Structures: Study common algorithms and data structures, such as sorting, searching, and graph algorithms, and how to implement them in Python.

6. Best Practices: Learn about best practices in coding, such as using functions and modules to organize code, writing documentation, and using version control systems.

7. Additionally, you can find many online tutorials and resources to help you along the way. It's important to practice coding and solve real-world problems to gain hands-on experience with the language.

# 2. Fundamental python:
Variables: Variables are containers that store values. In Python, you don't need to declare the type of a variable, and you can assign values to variables using the equal (=) sign. For example: x = 5

## 2.1 Data Types: 
Python has several built-in data types, including integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), and lists (list).
```
a=3
b="Giang"
```
## 2.2 Operators: 
Python supports various arithmetic, comparison, and assignment operators that can be used to perform operations on variables.
ex: +,-,*,/,%
```
a=1
b=2 
a/b
```
## 2.3 Control Flow: 
Python has control flow statements such as if-else statements, for loops, and while loops, which allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.
### 2.3.1 if-else stattment:
if <condition> :
<do something>
else: 
<do something>
```
a=1
b=2
if a<b:
   print("a is smaller than b")
else:
   print("a is equal or larger than b")
```
### 2.3.2 while loop:
while <condition>:
  <do something>
```
i=i+1
while i<5:
  print(i)
  i=i+1         
```
        
### 2.3.3 for loops
for element in <sequences, list,dictionary,...>:
  print(element)
```
for i in "Giang"
    print(i)
```
  
## 2.4 Functions: 
Functions are blocks of code that can be reused throughout your program. In Python, you can define your own functions using the def keyword.

def <function_name>:
    <do something>
    return <the object that you cound retrieve if assign this function to variable>
```
def print_hello():
      print("Hello word")
      return "Hello word"
demo=print_hello
```

## 2.5 Modules: 
Modules are collections of related functions and variables. You can use modules to organize your code and reuse code across multiple projects.
```
from demo import print_hello   
```
## 2.6 Packages: 
Packages are collections of related modules. You can install and use packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) to extend the functionality of your program. There are multiple modules in packages, need to download and then 
Require to install from sources
```
pip3 install pandas
```
