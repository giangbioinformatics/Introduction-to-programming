# Introduction-to-programming
Here I want to introduce the programming with bash, python and bash scrirpt for everyone who interested in bioinformtics
## [01. Introduction to bashscript](https://github.com/giangbioinformatics/Introduction-to-programming/blob/main/01.introduction_to_bash_script)
In this section, I provided the basic built-in functions that could be used for working on bash scripts. 
## [02. Programming with bashscript](https://github.com/giangbioinformatics/Introduction-to-programming/blob/main/02.Programming_with_bash_script.md)
I provided the basic programming,include: syntax, comment, variable, datatype, condition, loop and function. Combined with previous section to create more advanced bash scripts.
