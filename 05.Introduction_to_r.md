# 1. Data Types:

Numeric: x <- 5  
Integer: x <- as.integer(5)  
Character: x <- "hello"  
Logical: x <- TRUE  
# 2. Operators:

Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, ^  
Example: result <- 5 + 2 * 3  
Comparison: <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=  
Example: result <- 5 > 3  
Logical: & (and), | (or), ! (not)  
Example: result <- (5 > 3) & (2 < 4)  
# 3. Variables:  

Assign value to a variable using <-  
Example: x <- 5  
# 4. Flow Control:  

if statement:  
```
if (x > 0) {
  print("x is positive")
}
```
if else statement:
```
if (x > 0) {
  print("x is positive")
} else {
  print("x is non-positive")
}
```
for loop:
```
for (i in 1:5) {
  print(i)
}
```
while loop:
```
i <- 1
while (i <= 5) {
  print(i)
  i <- i + 1
}
```
# 5. Functions:

Define a function using function keyword  

```
add <- function(a, b) {
  return (a + b)
}
```
# 6. Vectors and Matrices:

Create a vector: x <- c(1, 2, 3)  
Access elements of a vector: x[1]  
Create a matrix: x <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)  
Access elements of a matrix: x[1, 2]  
These are just some of the basic R programming concepts. To learn more, check out online resources such as the R documentation and online tutorials.
# 7. To install and use packages in R, you can follow these steps:

Open R Studio or R Console and type the following command: install.packages("package_name"), where "package_name" is the name of the package you want to install.

Once the package is installed, you can load it into your R environment by typing library(package_name) in the R console.

You can use the functions and features of the package in your R script by referring to the package documentation or using the help function, for example help(package_name).

If you want to install a package from a specific repository, you can use the repos argument in the install.packages function, for example install.packages("package_name", repos="https://cran.r-project.org/").

If you need to update a package, you can use the update.packages function, for example update.packages(oldPkgs = "package_name", repos = "https://cran.r-project.org/").
